This project reproduces and extends findings from Hong et al. on cytotoxic CD4⁺ T cell expansion and immune dysregulation in Primary Sjögren’s Syndrome (pSS). Using Seurat for scRNA-seq analysis, I processed 58k+ immune cells, performed QC, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and identified pSS-specific biomarkers. Visualizations include UMAPs, heatmaps, and violin plots highlighting top genes like GZMA/GZMB.
